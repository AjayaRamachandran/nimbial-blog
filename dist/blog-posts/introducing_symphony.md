Symphony is designed to bridge the gap in existing music production software, bringing pro-level experimentation tools to entry-level users without the premium cost. Designed to be easy to learn, while providing ample headroom for pros, Symphony is an extremely powerful tool that you can add to your workflow today.

## What makes Symphony different?
Modern music production tools exist in 2 groups. On one side, we have complex, multipurpose music production tools that cost a fortune, that are usually geared toward audio production and building a final product. On the other end, we have ancient freeware on life support, which are usually not user-friendly and don't have updated documentation. For a new user trying to enter the music world, it's quite intimidating to know where to begin.

Symphony is designed for exactly that type of user. We're not trying to replace FL studio, and we're not trying to be the next Audacity. Rather, this program is designed to be a portal into those other workflows, a space where you can create (and learn *how* to create) experimentative musical project ideas that would be squashed the moment you tried to make it through MuseScore's long-winded project setup screens. It's meant to be as fast as your randomest musical whims. And it does that well, at least according to the many beta testers we've put it in the hands of.

## Why is Symphony free? What's the catch?
I made Symphony as a passion project to fill a hole in *my* workflow, as I was dissatisfied with the existing tools available. Put simply, Symphony is free because I don't want anyone else to be stuck where I was, filled with ideas but unable to make them a reality. If you do support the cause, and want to see more updates or other tools in the Nimbial space, then you can [donate](https://symphony.nimbial.com/support) and show your love. But just spreading the word - about what Nimbial is trying to accomplish, and what we do here - is doing a lot, so thank you.

Long term, I have a lot of plans for Symphony (and Nimbial as a whole), including some cloud-based collaboration tools that could run on an affordable subscription model. I do *not* have plans on integrating AI into Symphony, as I do believe that Artificial Intelligence has no place in the creative process. However, there may be AI integrations in other parts of the Nimbial suite.
